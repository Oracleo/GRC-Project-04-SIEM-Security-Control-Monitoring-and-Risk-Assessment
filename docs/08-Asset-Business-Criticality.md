# 8. Asset Business Criticality & Context Analysis

In a professional GRC environment, a failed login attempt on a generic desktop is viewed differently than one on a critical server. For this risk engagement, we contextualize the **Target Windows 10 Host (`NATIONALIST`)** as follows:

## 8.1 Asset Profile
| Asset Attribute | Assigned Context |
|:---|:---|
| **Hostname** | `NATIONALIST` |
| **Business Function** | Finance and HR Department Workstation |
| **Data Sensitivity** | **High.** Handles employee payroll records and access to internal financial databases. |
| **Regulatory Footprint** | Subject to **GDPR** (EU employee data) and local financial fraud regulations. |
| **Operational Criticality** | Mission-critical. A compromise of the `Dr.Nee` (Admin) account on this host would allow lateral movement to the entire finance infrastructure. |

## 8.2 Impact Analysis Matrix
| Threat Scenario | Operational Impact | Compliance Impact | Financial/Reputational Impact |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Brute-Force (T1110) leading to successful admin login** | Unauthorized access to financial systems. | Violates GDPR Article 32 if payroll/PII is exfiltrated. | **~$500,000+** direct financial loss. Severe loss of client trust. |
| **Delayed Incident Response (Alert not routed)** | Attacker has extended window of opportunity (minutes to hours). | Violates NIST RS.AN-1 (Investigations). | Irreparable data loss if attackers move laterally before the SOC responds. |

## 8.3 Conclusion on Priority Scoring
The lack of account lockout and MFA is escalated to a **Critical P1** because this asset sits at the gateway to the organization's financial and HR data. The priority matrix in `05-Risk-Register.md` is driven by the high business impact of a privileged account compromise on this specific host.
