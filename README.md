**A structured access control monitoring lab using Splunk SIEM to detect brute-force authentication activity.** 
This project establishes a continuous compliance oversight framework—from deploying Splunk Enterprise and ingesting Windows Security Event Logs (EventCode 4625), to developing SPL detection logic, configuring real-time threshold-based alerting, and producing an audit-grade incident report mapped to ISO 27001, NIST CSF, and MITRE ATT&CK.

## Project at a Glance (For Recruiters & Hiring Managers)

| Area | Details |
|:---|:---|
| **Threat Detected** | Brute Force Authentication Attack (T1110.001 - Password Guessing) |
| **Detection Method** | Splunk SPL query searching for 3+ failed logon events (EventCode 4625) per account. |
| **Lab Environment** | Splunk Enterprise (Kali) ↔ Windows 10 (UF) on Bridged Network. |
| **Key Finding** | 8 failed attempts (4 per account) detected. Real-time alert operationalized. |
| **Framework Mapped** | ISO 27001 (A.8.15, A.8.16, A.5.17), NIST CSF (DE.CM-1, PR.AC-7). |
